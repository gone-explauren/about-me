## About-Me

I'm building a website all about me, my goals, and Britney Spears I guess, using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I'm learning in class.

### Reflections and Comments

* Lab-02: I'm having a lot of fun with this assignment. I think the repitition is really helping me learn code. JavaScript has been fun to learn and not that difficult so far. I'm really excited to learnwhat I can do with CSS, as I haven't used it much so far. Also, I am very, very unsure about using images in HTML...

* Lab-03: Today's lab was pretty rough. I was able to figure out the "How many times have I cried this week" loop without much issue, but when I nested the loops in "What is my favorite Britney era," I ran into some problems figuring out what code should go inside what loop. I had to get some help with this. Finding a way to count the number of correct answers was fairly easy for me, and once the wholwe thing was running as it should, it was so, so satisfying.
