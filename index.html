		<h4>Hey Laurel, where did you go to school?</h4>
		<br>
		<p>Oh, good question!</p>
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2020 with a degree in Art and a focus in Photography.</li>
		<li>I minored in Korean, just for fun I guess.</li>
		<li>Don't ask me to translate anything for you, though, because you'd be straight outta luck.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>I'm currently enrolled in a Software Developer bootcamp through Code Fellows in Seattle, WA. I'm learning a lot about html, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm having a great time!</p>

		<h5>Hey Laurel, what about your career experience?</h5>
		<br>
	<p>I have some of that!</p>
	<br>
		<ul>
		<li>Right out of high school, I joined the Navy as an Aviation Electronics Technician.</li>
		<li>I worked on helicopters in San Diego, and then lived on a ship for a year in Norfolk Virginia.</li>
		<br>
		<li>I got a part time job as a cashier at Whole Foods Market while I was in school, and then went full time after graduation.</li>
		<li>I became the Associate Team Lead of the Custmer Service Department and learned a lot about the administrative side of the retail industry.</li>

		<h6>Hey Laurel, what's next?</h6>
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>Next I'm going to improve my coding skills, become a rock star dev, make my mama proud of me, and fill my pockets with Benjamins</li>
		<br>
		<li>&#129297;&#129297;&#129297; </li>
		<br>
		<li>Outside of school, I'm also learning American Sign Language and writing a book of poetry, as well as working on some conceptual photography projects.</li>
		<br>
		<li>I always have a new skill I want to learn or improve upon because, after all, curiosity is the spice of life, or something like that.</li>

			<h7>Top Ten Favorite Vegan Cheeses</h7>
			<div>
				<br>
			<!-- ol>li*10 -->
			<ol>
				<li>Violife Mozzerella 
					Shreds</li>
					<p>Tastes great on pizza and melts almost like the real thing, no harm involved. Truly a superior cheese.</p>
				<li>Forager Queso Fresco</li>
				<p>Adds a perfect gooey texture to enchiladas. Chef's kiss.</p>
				<li>Miyoko's Garlic Herb Cheese</li>
				<p>Perfect cheese for a charcuterie board alongside some mushroom jerky.</p>
				<li>Daiya Key Lime Cheezecake</li>
				<p>The only acceptable product from Daiya and yes cheesecake counts as cheese, don't @ me.</p>
				<li>Babybel Plant Based Cheese</li>
				<p>We sampled this once at Whole Foods and my boss said, "They got the flavor right, but the texture feels like rubber." I couldn't tell, but I also don't remember what animal cheese feels like, so whatever.</p>
				<li>365 Vegan Mozzerella</li>
				<p>Speaking of WFM, this store brand cheese is a good, cheap substitute for my number one pick, the Violife mozz. It's perfect if you're still a week out from payday but need to use up that dough ball in your freezer.</p>
				<li>Treeline Goat Cheese</li>
				<p>Another great one for your cheese board.</p>
				<li>Feild Road Chao Slices</li>
				<p>A perfect grilled cheese go-to. I reccommend the Tomato Cayenne flavor.</p>
				<li>Nuts for Cheese Un-Brie-Lievable</li>
				<p>Authentic tasting cheese to pair with wine and feel fancy. They also make a vegan bleu cheese, but tbh I haven't tred it and I'm a lil nervous to.</p>
				<li>Follow Your Heart Parmesan</li>
				<p>Another pizza party must-have. The first vegan cheese brand I ever tried, Follow Your Heart will always have a special place in my fridge.</p>
