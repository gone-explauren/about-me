<h2>You wanna learn HTML?</h2>
<p>Yes!</p>
<h2>Kick ass at CSS?</h2>
<p>Yes!</p>
<h2>Make JavaScript your bitch?</h2>
<p>I better work like, really really hard and put forth my best effort so that I can become the best coder I can be and maybe one day I'll get a fun and fulfilling career in tech and make my mama real proud of me.</p>
<br>
<p>Oh, and I guess here's a lil more about me...</p>
<br>
<h4>Hey Laurel, where did you go to school?</h4>
<p>Oh, good question! I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2020 with a degree in Art and a focus in Photography. I minored in Korean, just for fun I guess. Don't ask me to translate anything for you, though, because you'd be SOL.</p>
<p>I'm currently enrolled in a Software Developer bootcamp through Code Fellows in Seattle, WA, and I'm having a great time!</p>
<h4>Hey Laurel, what about your career experience?</h4>
<p>I have some of that! Right out of high school, I joined the Navy as an Aviation Electronics Technician. I worked on helicopters in San Diego, and then lived on a ship for a year in Norfolk Virginia.</p>
<p>I got a part time job as a cashier at Whole Foods Market while I was in school, and then went full time after graduation. I became the Associate Team Lead of the Custmer Service Department and learned a lot about the administrative side of the retail industry.</p>
<h4>Hey Laurel, what's next?</h4>
<p>Next I'm going to improve my coding skills, become a rock star dev, and fill my pockets with Benjamins &#129297;&#129297;&#129297; </p>
