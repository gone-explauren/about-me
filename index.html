			</ul>

			<p>I have to add some more things to my website now, so enjoy this lovely list of my</p>
			<h7>Top Ten Favorite Vegan Cheeses</h7>
			<!-- ol>li*10 -->
			<ol>
				<li>Violife Mozzerella 
					Shreds</li>
					<p>Tastes great on pizza and melts almost like the real thing, no harm involved. Truly a superior cheese.</p>
				<li>Forager Queso Fresco</li>
				<p>Adds a perfect gooey texture to enchiladas. Chef's kiss.</p>
				<li>Miyoko's Garlic Herb Cheese</li>
				<p>Perfect cheese for a charcuterie board alongside some mushroom jerky.</p>
				<li>Daiya Key Lime Cheezecake</li>
				<p>The only acceptable product from Daiya and yes cheesecake counts as cheese, don't @ me.</p>
				<li>Babybel Plant Based Cheese</li>
				<p>We sampled this once at Whole Foods and my boss said, "They got the flavor right, but the texture feels like rubber." I couldn't tell, but I also don't remember what animal cheese feels like, so whatever.</p>
				<li>365 Vegan Mozzerella</li>
				<p>Speaking of WFM, this store brand cheese is a good, cheap substitute for my number one pick, the Violife mozz. It's perfect if you're still a week out from payday but need to use up that dough ball in your freezer.</p>
				<li>Treeline Goat Cheese</li>
				<p>Another great one for your cheese board.</p>
				<li>Feild Road Chao Slices</li>
				<p>A perfect grilled cheese go-to. I reccommend the Tomato Cayenne flavor.</p>
				<li>Nuts for Cheese Un-Brie-Lievable</li>
				<p>Authentic tasting cheese to pair with wine and feel fancy. They also make a vegan bleu cheese, but tbh I haven't tred it and I'm a lil nervous to.</p>
				<li>Follow Your Heart Parmesan</li>
				<p>Another pizza party must-have. The first vegan cheese brand I ever tried, Follow Your Heart will always have a special place in my fridge.</p>
